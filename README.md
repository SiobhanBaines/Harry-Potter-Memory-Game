# Siobhan-Baines-MS2-Harry Potter-Themed-Game

The concept of this game is a simple pattern following game where each of the Hogwarts houses crests are the buttons which will light up creating a pattern. 
The game will randomly light up one of the 4 crests and the player will need to click on that crest. The game will then light up that crest followed by another randomly selected crest which could be the same as the first crest and the player will need to click on the correct crests to follow the pattern. The game will continue until the visitor makes a mistake when the game will let the player know they have failed with an Harry Potter related message which will be linked to the house of the crest last clicked on by the player.

## User Experience (UX)

### *User Stories*

1. **A new visitor to the site**
I am looking for a game that will help improve my memory, is easy to play and looks fun. The instructions need to easy to access and easy to follow. It might be interesting to know aout the background to the game and its design.
  
2. **The site creator**
I want a game that uses different coloured lights to create a 'copy me' routine. The game must give feedback in a fun way relating to Harry Potter and the Hogwarts houses. 
* Gryffindor are known their for bravery, helping others and chivalry
* Slytherin are known for their ambition, cunning, heritage and resourcefulness
* Hufflepuff are known for their hardwork, patience, loyalty and fair play
* Ravenclaw are known for their intelligence, knowledge, forward planning and humour.
Since I am using Harry Potter as the theme I feel it is only right to talk a little about the author of Harry Potter in the about section.



### *Strategy*
The objective of this website is to create an interactive and fun game for a user. The user must want to interact with the website and the website must inturn react to the interaction of the user. I want the site to look enticing to an individual and to give the individual feedback on how they are doing in the game.

### *Scope*
The concept of the game is based on the 'Simon' game of the 1980's in the style of Harry Potter. The website needs to be easy to use, information must be readily accessible including the instructions of how to play the game. When the website responseds to the players action it needs to be clear and fun. The initial landing page will have the Hogwarts crest and a 'Welcome to Hogwarts' banner. Clicking on the crest will take the player into the game itself which will then invite the player to start the game. One of the Hogwarts house crests will give the illusion of lighting up and the player will need to click on the same Hogwarts house to move upto the next level. The website will add to the pattern by lighting the inital house and a randomly selected second house. Each time the player fails to follow the pattern correctly 50 points will be awarded to the final house in the pattern and a message will appear on the screen which is relevant to that house.

### *Structure*
The crests will be grouped together in sqaure in the centre. There will be a scoreboard at the top of the screen showing each house. I will add a dropdown menu so the player can find out the rules of the game and some details about the author of Harry Potter and the four houses in Hogwarts

### *Surface*
I am using 5 crests in the website [Hogwarts crest](), [Gryffindor crest](), [Slytherin crest](), [Hufflepuff crest]() and [Ravenclaw crest]().The four house crests give me the colors red, green, yellow and blue for the illumination affect. I chose purple as the background to make the site seem more magical and exciting. I have used a bright yellow for the headings in keeping with the gold of Hogwarts. To give the site a more official feel I found the'Parry Hotter' font which is very similar to the real Harry Potter font.

## Features
### Existing Features
#### feature 1
When the home page loads it's position and opacity changes bringing the webpage to life. 
#### feature 2
I wanted the transition from the home page to the game page to be softer to appear smoother for the player.
#### feature 3
When the play fails to follow the pattern created by the crests lighting up a message relating to the last crest in the pattern pops up on a wooden board in yellow with a white boarder.

## Technologies Used
CSS3, HMTL5, Javscript, JQuery, Bootstrap Framework, Google, Fontawesome



##### Font style
Parry Hotter and Ubuntu.

## Credits
J K Rowling originally created the very successful Harry Potter series of books which is the core theme of this game.
### feature 1
I found out how to create the Home page movement and opacity from this YouTube video by [dcode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWB219zf1og)
### feature 3
My mentor Kyeza Arnold suggested a woodne background for the pop-up message. I found this more difficult to read and wanted a border around the font to make it stand out more. I added a black boarder and a red shadow. [css-font-border](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2570972/css-font-border)



When using Google to find out more information about various parts of my code that were not working as I expected I often used[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp), [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/).

# Deployment
In Gitpod the bottom area of the screen is where git commands are entered.
