1.	If you have been running the 8000 port you will need to use Ctrl + Z to escape back and use the command entry. This line will appear “gitpod /workspace/Siobhan-Baines-MS2-HP-Game $” allowing commands to be entered.
2.	Make sure any changes that have been made are save by selecting the ‘File’ tab and ‘Save All’
3.	Type “git add .” to add all the changes ready to be committed. Remember the full stop because this will add everything that has been save. If only one file has been changed that file name can be entered instead of the full stop
4.	Type “git commit -m” immediately followed by a description of the change(s) being committed to Github 
5.	Type “git push” which will push everything to Github
6.	Open Github and the repository the website is in. To the far right of the menu bar is the Settings tab. Select this and scroll down to “GitHub Pages”
7.	Under Source if the dropdown menu has “None” select the “master” branch which will bring up the “(root)” folder, and click “Save”
8.	Your page will now show as published under the GitHub Pages section
